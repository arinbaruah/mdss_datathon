```
We can observe that:

1. WA leads the way in waste generation followed by NSW and QLD.
2. While this maybe counter intuitive as WA has a considerably smaller population (2.67 million) when compared to NSW (8.16 million) and QLD (5.185 million), however, due to the presence of heavy industries such as mining, petroleum and chemicals, a significant amount of waste is generated in WA.
3. The most common form of waste generated from each state are observed to be ash and rubble.

pl1 <- treemap(df_waste_state,
            index=c("category","jurisdiction"),

# Hazardous waste

```{r}
df_haz <- df_waste %>% filter(category == "Hazardous wastes")
df_haz_tot <- df_haz %>% filter(stream == "Total")
df_haz_total <- df_haz_tot %>% group_by(start_year,jurisdiction,category) %>% 
  summarise(Tonnes = sum(tonnes)) %>% 
  ungroup() 



```

```{r}
pl1 <- ggplot(data = df_haz_total,aes(x = start_year,y = Tonnes/10^6)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(color='red') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,size=5)) + facet_wrap(~jurisdiction) + labs(x = "Year",y = "Mega tonnes",title = "Hazardous waste generated in each state",subtitle = "2006-2021") + theme_classic()

```

1.  NSW accounts for the highest hazardous waste in the whole of Australia with close to 8.5 MT. The hazardous wastes are on a rising trend.
2.  QLD is observed to record constant generation of hazardous waste each year with approximate 6 MT.
3.  VIC is observed to record a rising trend of hazardous waste in recent years with close to 5.75 MT in 2021.

## How is the Hazardous waste dealt with in each state ?

```{r}

haz_jurisdictions <- c("NSW","Vic","Qld")
df_haz_subset <- df_haz_tot %>% filter(jurisdiction %in% haz_jurisdictions)

df_haz_man <- df_haz_subset %>% group_by(jurisdiction,management) %>% 
  summarise(Tonnes = sum(tonnes)) %>% ungroup()


pl2 <- ggplot(data = df_haz_man,aes(x = reorder(management,Tonnes),y = Tonnes/10^6)) + geom_col(fill = "lightgray",color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~jurisdiction) + coord_flip() + geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, management == "Landfill"),fill = "darkred") + geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, management == "Landfill"),aes(label = round(Tonnes/10^6,1),hjust=1)) + geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, management == "Energy from waste facility"),fill = "green") + geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, management == "Landfill"),aes(label = round(Tonnes/10^6,1),hjust=1)) + geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, management == "Energy from waste facility"),aes(label = round(Tonnes/10^6,1),hjust=-0.5)) + 
  labs(x = "Waste management technique",y = "Mega tonnes of waste",title ="Hazardous waste management in the top 3 \n waste producing states",subtitle = "2006-2021") + theme_economist() 
pl2
```

We observe that the:

1.  In all the three states (NSW,Qld,Vic), majority of the hazardous waste are managed through disposing in landfills. While this may be a temporary solution, the implications can be quite devastating **as such waste normally take years to decompose and start polluting the water ways as well as pottable water resources.**

2.  While there have been efforts to utilise hazardous waste to produce energy, it is still a long way behind, with more concerted efforts required by each state to curb disposal of hazardous waste into landfills and obtain clean energy.

3.  While **VIC is observed to generate lesser hazardous waste than NSW and QLD, they're also leading with the highest energy production from waste facilities** with approximately 1.6 Mega tonnes of waste utilised.
